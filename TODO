* I hate Mako templating.
** Switch to Kid?  Was that actually good?  (Is it abandoned?)

* i18n of this app itself
** Use UI strings from Pootle, perhaps, and use their translations?

* show EN when editing ES
* In "edit string" UI, show suggestions as a smaller scrollable area of drop-downs
** Each suggestion has a (copy) (delete) button
** Saving when there are suggestions - OK is greyed out, and instead you get
   a note saying you have to click a "Delete all suggestions" button

* Actually handle "reason=" in action='login', controller='account'

== To let it run offline ==
* Create a local proxy or cache of the Yahoo UI APIs we use


== In the fullness of time ==
* Potential security problem with storing the db_user in the session?
** Better strategy: Store the db_user in this request, and 
                    reinstantiate the db_user from session.user_id freshly
                    when the session gets loaded at the start of the request.
