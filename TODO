== Soon ==
show suggstion UI independent of URL but dependent on 'translator' role
* Put suggestions in right place
* Actually handle "reason=" in action='login', controller='account'

== Sometime ==

* Provide UI for adding a domain

* i18n of this app itself
** Use UI strings from Pootle, perhaps, and use their translations?

=== To let it run offline ===
* Create a local proxy or cache of the Yahoo UI APIs we use
** Make a configuration parameter for the path to the YUI APIs

== Eventually ==
* I hate Mako templating.
** Switch to Kid?  Was that actually good?  (Is it abandoned?)
*** Genshi is the new Kid.
